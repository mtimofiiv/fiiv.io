      Originally started by Olivia Firth of Eco-Age, the #30wearschallenge is a
      social challenge to wear garments 30 times or more.

      I built a mobile app to facilitate this for a eco hackathon. You could add
      your garments, and track how many times you wear them.

      It really took off! A lot of people used it -
      <span class="bold">about 2 thousand active users</span>, in fact. But
      unfortunately, I just don't have the time to maintain it, so I had to take
      the sad step to discontinue it.

    <p>Thank you to all our users!</p>
